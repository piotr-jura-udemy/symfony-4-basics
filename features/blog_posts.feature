  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a blog post
    Given I am authenticated as "admin"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/blog_posts" with body:
    """
    {
      "title": "Hello a title",
      "content": "The content is suppose to be at least 20 characters",
      "slug": "a-new-slug"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON matches expected template:
    """
    {
      "@context": "/api/contexts/BlogPost",
      "@id": "@string@",
      "@type": "BlogPost",
      "comments": [],
      "id": @integer@,
      "title": "Hello a title",
      "content": "The content is suppose to be at least 20 characters",
      "slug": "a-new-slug",
      "published": "@string@.isDateTime()",
      "author": "/api/users/1",
